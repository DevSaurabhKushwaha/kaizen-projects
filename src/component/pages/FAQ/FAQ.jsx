        { question: "Why was Kai-Zen速 Developed?", answer: "Research tells us that 74% of how much you receive in retirement is based on how much cash (capital) you have set aside, and only 26% is a result of investment return. Put another way, the retirement concern is not about how your investments are doing, it is not having enough money to invest. This underfunding for retirement income is the issue Kai-Zen速 is helping to resolve and Kai-Zen速 is currently the only plan on the market where you can obtain leverage to this degree, without having to qualify for the loan and make interest payments." },
